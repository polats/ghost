To start getting into machine learning I started doing a small project — creating a script that would predict the brackets of The International. The International is the annual DOTA 2 hosted by Valve, and is the biggest tournament in terms of winnings in all of eSports. Due to crowdfunding, the current prize pool stands at $19,842,840, and is projected to reach more than $20,000,000 by the end of the tournament.
